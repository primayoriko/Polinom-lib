# Polinom Calculator Library
--------
A Library with Polinom class that have two inherits, each use brute force (O(n^2)) and karatsuba algorithm(O(n^1.58)). 

This library comes with main driver to test also a random polinom generator to make polinom to be tested.


## Instruction
------------

1. Run m or m.exe (depend on your platform) in bin folder
   
2. To view the source code, just go to src directory
   
3. To see some sample, go to ss directory

4. To recompile the the src code you just can run
   c.sh or c.bat  (depend on your platform, too) in bin file. Then execute this:

        bash c.sh

    If you're with linux, or

        c.bat

    If you use windows


## Note
-----

1. There maybe some bugs with dynamics allocation array to store polinom coefficients. So BEWARE of it!!
